# Memecoin Smart Contract

## Overview

Memecoin ERC-20 token incorporates ERC-20 Permit (EIP-2612) for gasless transactions, extending the basic functionalities of a standard ERC-20 token to enhance user experience in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It introduces a unique permission model that restricts the use of `permit` function to a designated address, referred to as the token pool, to mitigate risks associated with signature phishing attacks.

## Key Features

- **ERC-20 Compliance**: Ensures compatibility with the vast ecosystem of Ethereum-based applications.
- **ERC-20 Permit (EIP-2612)**: Allows gasless transactions by leveraging signatures for approvals, enhancing user experience.
- **Restricted Permit Usage**: Enhances security by limiting `permit` functionality to a predefined address, thereby protecting token holders from potential signature phishing.
